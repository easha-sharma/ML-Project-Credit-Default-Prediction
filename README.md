# Machine Learning Project – Credit Default Prediction

This project predicts whether a customer will default on credit payment using Machine Learning models.

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)
- Other baseline models

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
Logistic Regression and SVM performed better compared to other models.  
Performance can be improved using feature selection or ensemble models.
